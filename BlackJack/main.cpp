Blackjack is a classic card game played with a standard deck of cards.
The player receives two cards, and can take more if they want, attempting to
get close to 21, without going over!
The dealer also receives two cards, one of which is hidden until the end of the game.
Whoever has a higher total without going over 21 wins!
